##Order Food Eat Food

This app uses JavaScript and jQuery to simulate a food delviery service. An ajax call is used to retrieve a menu and then return an order.

deployed at: http://fair-rose.surge.sh/app/index.html

Additional Features I would add (with more time):
- Better CSS and formatting of the order page
- Clear menu for next order after order is sent
